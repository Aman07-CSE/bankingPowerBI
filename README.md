---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aman07-CSE/bankingPowerBI.git
cd bankingPowerBI
```

### 2. Prepare the Data
- Place your dataset(s) in the `datasets/` folder.  
- Ensure file types are compatible with your setup (e.g., `.csv`, `.xlsx`).

### 3. Run Exploratory Data Analysis
- Open `bankingAnalysisAndEDA.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.  
- Explore, visualize, and validate the dataset using the notebook.

### 4. Execute SQL Queries  
- Load your data (e.g., into SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.).  
- Run `sqlQueryBanking.sql` to transform and extract meaningful insights.

### 5. Visualize in Power BI  
- Launch Power BI Desktop and open `Banking Dashboard.pbix`.  
- Update data sources if needed.  
- Explore interactive visuals and insights.

## Components Description

### `datasets/`
Contains your banking data—ideally raw and cleaned versions. Formats may include `.csv`, `.xlsx`.

### `bankingAnalysisAndEDA.ipynb`
Notebook for:
- Initial data exploration  
- Data cleanup, transformations, summary statistics  
- Generating plots to understand variables and trends

### `sqlQueryBanking.sql`
SQL script designed for:
- Data extraction  
- Aggregations (e.g., by account type, customer segment, transaction category)  
- Joins and advanced queries that feed into Power BI

### `Banking Dashboard.pbix`
An interactive Power BI dashboard—typically showcasing:
- Trends over time  
- Customer segmentation  
- KPIs like transaction volume, average balance, etc.  
- Any custom visuals or DAX calculations

## How to Use

1. **Customize Data**: Replace sample data with your own under `datasets/`.  
2. **Adjust EDA Notebook**: Tailor analyses (charts, metrics) to your data schema.  
3. **Modify SQL Script**: Adapt queries to align with your data's structure and storage solution.  
4. **Update Power BI Report**: Refresh data connections and tweak visuals as needed.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python** (with packages like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, etc.)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (or VS Code + Jupyter extension)  
- **Database system or local SQL runtime** (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)  
- **Power BI Desktop** (to open and interact with `.pbix`)
